Authorization stack for the CakePHP framework.

This plugin is for CakePHP 3.6+.

**This is work in progress! Don't use it in a live app!**

## Authorization is not Authentication

This plugin intentionally **does not** handle authentication. It was [decoupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) from authentication on purpose for a clear [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). See also [Computer access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_access_control). This plugin handles only *authorization*. For *authentication* use the [CakePHP Authentication plugin](https://github.com/cakephp/authentication).
