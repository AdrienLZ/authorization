# Middleware & Component

Authorization is applied to your application as a middleware. The
`AuthorizationMiddleware` handles the following responsibilities:

* Decorating the request 'identity' with a decorator that adds the `can` and
  `applyScope` methods.
* Ensuring that authorization has been checked/bypassed in the request.

To use the middleware, update the `middleware` hook of your `Application` with
the following:

```php
// Import the class.
use Authorization\Middleware\AuthorizationMiddleware;

// inside your middleware hook.
$middleware->add(new AuthorizationMiddleware($this));
```

By passing your application instance into the middlware, it can invoke the
``authorization`` hook method on your application which should return
a configured `AuthorizationService`. A very simple example would be:

```php
namespace App;

use Authorization\AuthorizationService;
use Authorization\Policy\OrmResolver;
use Cake\Http\BaseApplication;

class Application extends BaseApplication
{
    public function authorization($request)
    {
        $resolver = new OrmResolver();

        return new AuthorizationService($resolver);
    }
}
```

The authorization service requires a policy resolver. See the 
[Policies](./Policies.md) documentation on what resolvers are available and how
to use them.

## AuthorizationComponent

The `AuthorizationComponent` exposes a few conventions based helper methods for
checking permissions from your controllers. It abstracts getting the user and
calling the `can` or `applyScope` methods. Using the AuthorizationComponent
requires use of the Middleware, so make sure it is applied as well. To use the
component, first load it:

```php
// In your AppController
public function initialize()
{
    parent::initialize();
    $this->loadComponent('Authorization.Authorization');
}
```

Then in your controller actions or callback methods you can check authorization:

```php
// In the Articles Controller.
public function edit($id)
{
    $article = $this->Articles->get($id);
    $this->Authorization->authorize($article);
    // Rest of the edit method.
}
```

Above we see an article being authorized for the current user. By the current
request's `action` is used for the policy method. You can choose
a policy method to use if necessary:

```php
// Use a policy method that doesn't match the current controller action.
$this->Authorization->authorize($article, 'update');
```

You can also apply policy scopes using the component:

```php
$query = $this->Authorization->authorizeScope($this->Articles->find());
```
